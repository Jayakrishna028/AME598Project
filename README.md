## Project-Description  

In the realm of transportation, autonomous vehicle technology is a developing field that involves creating cars that can operate independently of human intervention. These cars use a variety of sensors, including radar and cameras, to comprehend their environment. This technology aids in the safe navigation of the car by recognizing barriers, other cars, and roadways. This technology's primary objective is to lessen human mistake in driving, which could increase road safety and enhance traffic flow. Although they are still in the early stages of development, autonomous cars have the potential to revolutionize the way we view driving and transportation in the future.With this project I attempted to create a model of such a vehicle with the use of some basic sensors and Raspberry Pi.

## Improvements-and-Issues

This project being a basic one, it is did not utilize advanced sensors which limited the vehicles ability to understand its surroundings. the car model will not be able to detected obstacles outside the plane of the ultrasonic sensors. This limits the possibility for accurate movement. As ultrasonic sensors are used it is not possible for the robot to get a 360 view of its surroundings which is possible with a LIDAR. Use of depth sensors and Accelerometer will also help in localization of the robot with its surroudings which is not implemented in this project.

## About-Code-Explanation

the Server folder in the repo consists of the files required to  

## Future-Scope

I would like to imporve this project by using advances sensors and algorithms.
